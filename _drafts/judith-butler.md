[Judith Butler][judith-butler][^judith-creds], builds off of
previous research to build a theory of gender as a flexible and changing
expression of the self, as opposed to a stable identity. 

In this model, our societal experiences of gender as a fixed attribute is
built by our repeated actions, which creates the illusion that gender is a
stable identity when it might be better viewed as an expression of self that
changes in time. In other words, gender is a subjective construction that we
create through time, not a fixed objective reality of our experiences.

> gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an
> exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts. [^gender-trouble]
>
> *(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp214)*

These constructions are expressed as a performance that we demonstrate for
others using our bodies (a politically and socially regulated medium). They
signify our position in a gender hierarchy and the roles that we take on.

This performance must be repeated, and our self-surveillance and enforcement
ensures its consistency and apparent naturalism.

> Gender is […] a construction that regularly conceals its genesis; the tacit
> collective agreement to perform, produce, and sustain discrete and polar
> genders as cultural fictions is obscured by the credibility of those

> the construction "compels" our belief in its necessity and
> naturalness.[^gender-trouble]
> 
> *(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)*

The belief in the constructed story of gender that we perform, and the ways
that it is naturalized and enforced have created the perception of a concrete
and objective gender reality, and as a society we enforce these ideas regularly.

> Discrete genders are part of what "humanizes" individuals within contemporary
> culture; indeed, we regularly punish those who fail to do their gender 
> right. [^gender-trouble]

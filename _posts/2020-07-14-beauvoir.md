Simone De Beauvoir challenges the ways that primarily-male Western philosophers
characterized gender, specifically their restrictive definitions of femininity.

As we saw in the posts on [the western history of gender][gender-history],
philosophers largely viewed women as imperfect versions of men, and classified
men as practically divine and supremely logical beings operating beyond their
mortal coils. Beauvoir criticizes these outdated theories:

> Man vainly forgets that his anatomy also includes hormones and testicles. He
> grasps his body as a direct and normal link with the world that he believes
> he apprehends in all objectivity, whereas he considers woman's body an
> obstacle, a prison, burdened by everything that particularizes
> it.[^the-second-sex]

# The receipts

Beauvoir supports her claims by referencing the works of classical
philosophers, demonstrating the ways that masculine superiority has impacted
large schools of thought:

* [Aristotle][aristotle-post], a famous philosopher who continues to have
  influence in modern philosophy, stated that "the female is female by virtue
  of a certain lack of qualities, \[...\] we should regard women's nature as
  suffering from natural defectiveness."[^the-second-sex]
  *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*
* [Saint Thomas][thomas-post], who influenced the Catholic church, declared
  that women were an "incomplete man," and an "incidental"
  being.[^the-second-sex] *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*
* Many interpretations of [Genesis II][genesis-post], where the creation of Eve
  from Adam’s redundant and extraneous rib-bone is taken to symbolize reliance
  and submission.

Beauvoir concludes that ancient philosophers defined men as the default,
and women as merely an object in relation to men; not as an individual.

> Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to
> himself; she is not considered an autonomous being.[^the-second-sex]
>
> *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*

## What is femininity?

Recognizing that femininity has been historically defined as _distinctly not
masculine_ is important to understanding our modern ideas of femininity,
and gender in general, as an identifying trait.

If our definition for a gender is the lack of another identifier, we run into
issues of categorization.

- What does it mean to be a woman if womanhood is simply not-manhood?
- What about men who do not conform to the [hegemonic][webster-hegemony] ideas
  of masculinity?
- What does it mean to identify as a man, and subsequently as a non-man?

These historical ideas about gender don’t help us to understand people’s
experiences.

Discussions surrounding the philosophy of gender have come a long way since the
days of Aristotle and St. Augustine. Although historical interpretations of
gender have continued to broadly influence our culture, modern and contemporary
philosophers have expanded the discipline, providing more nuanced understandings
of human biology, psychology, and sociology. Looking at the works of Simone De
Beauvoir, Michael Foucault, Suzanne Kessler, Wendy McKenna, and Judith Butler we
will investigate:

* What is gender? Where does it come from?
* How do we understand claims of gender authenticity if there is no biological
dichotomy between sexes?
* Is gender natural or constructed, and what does this mean for contemporary
society?
* Do these questions even have a relevant answer in current society?

**Through our investigation, we will discover that theories of gender have been
varied, and that gender is viewed as a subjective experience of identity that is
created by repeated performances made by individuals.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Simone De Beauvoir – what is women?

Beauvoir challenges the ways that societies of primarily-male Western
philosophers have characterized ideas of gender, specifically their restrictive
definitions of femininity. These philosophers largely viewed women as imperfect
versions of men, and classified men as practically divine and supremely logical
beings operating beyond their mortal coils. Beauvoir criticizes these outdated
theories:

> "Man vainly forgets that his anatomy also includes hormones and testicles. He
> grasps his body as a direct and normal link with the world that he believes he
> apprehends in all objectivity, whereas he considers woman's body an obstacle, a
> prison, burdened by everything that particularizes it."[^the-second-sex]
>
> *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*

Beauvoir supports her claims by referencing the works of classical philosophers,
demonstrating the ways that masculine superiority has impacted large schools of
thought:

* Aristotle, a famous philosopher who continues to have influence in modern
philosophy, stated that "the female is female by virtue of a certain lack of
qualities, \[...\] we should regard women's nature as suffering from natural
defectiveness."[^the-second-sex] *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*
* Saint Thomas, whose influenced the Catholic church, declared that women were
an "incomplete man," and an "incidental" being.[^the-second-sex] *(De Beauvoir, The
second sex, pp2014)*
* Many interpretations of Genesis II, where the creation of Eve from Adam’s
redundant and extraneous rib-bone is taken to symbolize reliance and
submission.

Beauvoir concludes that ancient philosophers have defined men as the default,
and women are merely an object that is considered in relation to men; not as an
individual.

> "Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to
> himself; she is not considered an autonomous being."[^the-second-sex]
>
> *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*

Recognizing that femininity has been historically defined as distinctly not
masculine is important to understand the idea of femininity (and gender in
general) as an identifying trait. If our definition for a gender is the lack of
another identifier, we run into issues of categorization. What does it mean to
be a women if womanhood is simply not-manhood? What about men who do not conform
to the [hegemonic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hegemony) ideas of
masculinity? What does it mean to identify as a man, and subsequently as a
non-man? These historical ideas about gender don’t help us to understand
people’s experiences.

## Kessler and McKenna – the subjective categorization of gender

The importance of determining another person’s gender is observed by Kessler and
McKenna in their work “The Primacy of Gender Attribution.” They argue that we
assign gender and make assumptions about people based off of our assignment
before all other actions, and that we retroactively justify our attribution
instead of making the attribution based on a defined criterion.

> "Part of being a socialized member of a group is knowing the rules for giving
> acceptable evidence for categorization." [^gender]
>
> *(Kessler and McKenna, Gender: an ethnomethodological approach, pp6)*

Identification of another’s gender is key for our understanding of their roles,
as well as how to interact with them, what to expect from them, and how to
interpret their actions. These roles and the primacy of gender attribution are
taught through a variety of social institutions, including religion, school,
parents, etc. and inform our actions from an early age. They note that when an
individual’s gender is perceived as ambiguous, other people often showed signs
of unease as they tried to place the individual into a gender category.[^gender]

> "The primacy of gender attribution becomes obvious when we recognize that
> assignment and identity can be seen as special cases of attribution, and, even
> more importantly, that in order to meaningfully interpret someone's assignment,
> identity, and role, and the relationship among them, one must first attribute
> gender."[^gender]
>
> *(Kessler and McKenna, Gender: an ethnomethodological approach, pp17)*

Many subscribe to the assumption that all things have an objective truth,
including the human experience. This notion uses the gender binary as a tool to
categorize within reality. However making these assumptions and attempting
construct other experiences within an objective view of reality is inherently
flawed, since experiences are by definition subjective and require
interpretation from the perceiver.

The idea that gender is a core and stable part of someone’s identity comes from
the assumption that all things have an objective truth, including the human
experience. This notion uses the gender binary as a tool to categorize within
reality. However, making these assumptions and attempting to construct human
experience within an objective view of reality is inherently flawed, since
experiences are by definition subjective and require interpretation from the
perceiver.

> "A defining feature of reality construction is to see our world as being the
>  only possible one." [^gender]
>
> *(Kessler and McKenna, Gender: an ethnomethodological approach, pp18)*

## Judith Butler – Gender as a performance

[Judith Butler](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/judith-butler), a [Fellow
of the British Academy](https://www.britac.ac.uk/)  and a professor in the
Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory at the
University of California, Berkeley, builds off of the works of those before her.
She uses previous research and conclusions to form a theory on societal
experiences of gender as a repeated performance that creates our ideas of gender
as a stable identity when it might be better viewed as an expression of self
that changes in time.

> "Gender ought not to be construed as a stable identity or locus of agency from
> which various acts follow; rather, gender is an identity tenuously constituted
> in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of 
> acts." [^gender-trouble]
>
> *(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp214)*

In her work, Butler argues that gender is a construction that we create through
time, not a fixed objective reality of our experiences. These constructions are
expressed as a performance that we demonstrate for others using a politically
and socially regulated medium (our bodies), signifying our position in a gender
hierarchy and the roles that we take on. This performance must be repeated, and
our self-surveillance and enforcement ensures its consistency and apparent
naturalism.

> "Gender is […] a construction that regularly conceals its genesis; the tacit
> collective agreement to perform, produce, and sustain discrete and polar genders
> as cultural fictions is obscured by the credibility of those productions— and
> the punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them; the construction
> "compels" our belief in its necessity and naturalness."[^gender-trouble]
> 
> *(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)*

The belief in the constructed story of gender that we perform, and the ways that
it is naturalized and enforced have created the perception of a concrete
objective reality, and as a society we enforce these ideas regularly.

> "Discrete genders are part of what "humanizes" individuals within contemporary
> culture; indeed, we regularly punish those who fail to do their gender 
> right." [^gender-trouble]
>
> (Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)

## Michael Foucault – who decides the categories?

When discussing the power of characterization and categorization it is important
to discuss the works of Michael Foucault, a French philosopher that is primarily
known for his ideas around the ways humans categorize things, and how that power
manifests itself in the ways people interact with each other. His work on
categorization and power structures is used in many fields including psychology
and sociology.

Our exploration of gender begins to concern Foucault’s when we begin to question
the ways that gender is a categorization of behaviour that influences how we
expect people to act and the ways that we act around others.

Without the concept of categorization, no mechanism of classification or
description would be present.

> "...one that does not distribute the multiplicity of existing things into any of
> the categories that make it possible for us to name, speak, and 
> think."[^the-order-of-things]
>
> *(Foucault, The order of things: an archaeology of the human sciences, XIX)*

Given the importance of categorization as a method of describing differences and
communicating concepts, what does this mean for gender? Historically, Western
society recognizes two genders, which are rationalized using naturalistic
arguments. We can see in the historical record the factors and power dynamics
that lead Western society to settle on two, and the ways naturalistic arguments
were constructed to support this idea. Comparatively, modern theorists also have
records of other societies that use more than two categories, providing a
counter-example to any naturalistic arguments.

The way gender categories are formed in different societies is an area of
particular interest. Why is it that Western society continues to frame its
populations in terms of two genders, despite 
[growing research](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/10930654/Facebooks-71-gender-options-come-to-UK-users.html)
on and [support](http://time.com/4703058/time-cover-story-beyond-he-or-she/)
for intersex, trans\*, and gender queer people who did not fit into these
categories?

The story of Western gender constructs is largely informed by the power dynamics
of society. The individuals in power have the power to manipulate the
categorizations we use, whether they be church officials like St Thomas Aquinas,
educators and popular philosophizes like Aristotle, or the people around us who
may rely our actions to an authority or someone whom we respect. As we are all
enforcing, attributing, and assuming each others genders, we are all partially
responsible for perpetuating and normalizing the ideas of gender that are often
perceived to be objective truths.

## Where do we go now?

We’ve established that gender is a subjective experience that is constructed as
a sustained performance, but what does this mean for contemporary society?

Revisiting our initial questions going into this exploration:

* What is gender? Where does it come from?
* How do we understand claims of gender authenticity if there is no biological
dichotomy between sexes?
* Is gender natural or constructed, and what does this mean for contemporary
society?
* Do these questions have a relevant answer in current society?

We still don’t have a concrete answer to some of these, but perhaps the answers
are less relevant than we originally believed. How can we move forward where our
ideas of each other are not informed by our stereotypes of a particular role,
and be more intentional and thoughtful with our interactions?

Moving forward it is important to recognize that popularized ideas surrounding
gender are a disservice to society. We as a global community can do better, and
should work to bring an intersectional and progressive view of gender into more
mainstream view.

A more important consideration is if we are even capable of fully investigating
and changing the system. For those of us who live within the systems that we are
aiming to critique, we come to the question how we can have the knowledge to
critique it.

Classifying men and women is a categorization problem, and to do any
categorization, we need to know what defines their similarities and
differences. 

This is the work that Aristotle was doing in _Generation of Animals_;
attempting to establish that men and women were of the same species, and
additionally to describe the differences.

## Form, function, and bodily fluids

He began with the prevailing Western theory: that all differences between
entities were caused by changes in energy (or temperature). Heat caused
transformations (destruction, reproduction, etc.) whereas cold caused things to
stagnate and slow down. This was similar to the elemental (earth, wind,
fire, water) rubrics that were also in use at the time.

Using this framework, Aristotle theorized that there is a perfect definition,
called a form, for each object in reality, and reality consisted of
mostly-imperfect replicas of that form (a theory called hylomorphism).
Differences in function resulted in alternative definitions/forms.
He then investigated the variations between the the fluids men and women
produced as a starting point for his theories on the differentiation of sex.

The prevailing theory of the time stated that menstrual blood/fluid was the
female equivalent to semen, partly based on the temperature difference
between menstrual fluid and semen. This makes the fluids the same in form
(definition), but different in reality (matter). Aristotle built off this work
to try and determine why there was a difference in matter.

## Accidental women

Building on the theory that the fluids were the same in form, Aristotle argued
that men and women did not differ in their functions, but only by accident of
creation. He accepted there are differences within male and female, but
believed they were due to imperfections in the ways that people are born. Since
most scholars believed the function of humankind was to reproduce, this meant
that the men with the hot semen (who controlled reproduction) were more perfect
replicas of the form of a human.

These "accidents of creation" were due to the heat that was available
during procreation. If a man had children that looked exactly like them, that
meant that the father was viral and hot; in other words, the man could exact his
will on creation. It is noteworthy that Aristotle’s theories allowed for men to
have variable will-power, such that a man could have a perfect child one time
but imperfect (female) the next.

The idea that women are an imperfect version of men, and that men are the
aggressive decision makers of creation is a narrative that is still propagated.
The idea that men are naturally aggressive, that they control reproduction,
that the sperm fight for the egg are all ideas that stem from Aristotle’s
original ideas about sex. This model is generally considered to be the "one-sex
model" since it states that there is one type of human, and variations in sex
are accidental.

## Contradictions

Unfortunately (or fortunately) there is a contradiction in this theory:

- Men can recreate a perfect form through enforcing their will on nature, but
- Women cannot pass on their genes by enforcing their will on nature (because
    they do not have the ability to produce semen).

The difference between the ability to procreate and the inability to procreate
is a major difference in function, which would imply a difference in form.

(Also, menstrual fluid is not similar to semen.)

Despite the flaws in this theory, students are still taught about the
aggressive nature of sperm and the passivity of the egg (despite research to
the contrary), women are still thought to have little control over
reproduction, and the one sex model still influences modern ideas of medication
and treatment.

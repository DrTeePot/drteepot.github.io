When discussing the power of [characterization][defn-characterization] and
[categorization][defn-categorization], Michael Foucault is a contemporary
thought-leader.

Michael Foucault is a French philosopher primarily known for his ideas
around categorization, and how power manifests itself in our interactions with
each other. His work on categorization and its relationship to power
structures is used in many fields including psychology and sociology.

## Categorization as communication

An exploration of gender intersects with Foucault’s work when view gender as a
categorization of behaviour. As we've [seen in][kessler-post] [other
works][butler-post], our categorization of gender also influences how we
expect people to act and the ways that we act around others.

Without the concept of categorization, no mechanism of classification or
description would be present, which would prevent us from being able to
describe anything, and without the ability to describe, we loose the ability
to communicate, even possibly to think.[^multiplicity]

[^multiplicity]: Foucault uses a thought experiment of a language or system
    with too many or too little categories, hypothesizing that such a language
    "does not distribute the multiplicity of existing things into any of the
    categories that make it possible for us to name, speak, and think."
    *(Foucault, The order of things: an archaeology of the human sciences, XIX)*

To summarize:

- Categorization is important as a method of describing differences and communicating concepts.
- There is a relationship between power and the categorizations used in a society.
- Gender is a system of categorization.

Therefore, Western ideas of gender are related to the power structures in
Western society.

## The Western context

Historically, Western society recognizes two genders, which are rationalized
using naturalistic arguments.[^define-naturalism]

[^define-naturalism]: Naturalism in this case is referring to metaphysical
    naturalism, which is the argument that a trait ["related to consciousness
    and the mind are reducible to, or supervene upon,
    nature."][wiki-naturalism]

    In this case, the specific theory is
    [bio-determanism][bio-determinism-wiki].

[wiki-naturalism]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)
[bio-determinism-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_determinism

The factors and power dynamics that lead Western society to settle on two, and
the ways naturalistic arguments were constructed to support this idea, are
[easy to find in our historical literature][gender-history]. However,
contemporary researchers also have records of other societies that use more
than two categories, providing a counter-example to any naturalistic
arguments.[^counter-example]

[^counter-example]: Naturalistic arguments rely on the idea that a trait
    is inherent to all people regardless of their culture or society (i.e.
    the trait is inherent to human biology). Since there exists at least one
    society that does not have only two genders, we know that this isn't a
    trait that is solely biological.

We know gender isn't a biological trait; the way gender categories are
formed in different societies is complicated and unfortunately not well
understood. Why is it that Western society continues to frame its populations
in terms of two genders, despite [growing research][facebook-gender] on and
[support][time-gender] for intersex, trans\*, and gender queer people who did
not fit into these categories?

## Back to Foucault

The story of Western gender constructs is largely informed by the power
dynamics of society. The individuals in power manipulate the
categorizations we use, whether they be church officials like [St Thomas
Aquinas][thomas-post], educators and philosophers like
[Aristotle][aristotle-post], or even the people around us who may relay our
actions to an authority or someone whom we respect.

As we all enforce, attribute, and assume each others gender, we are all
partially responsible for perpetuating and normalizing the Western ideas of
gender.

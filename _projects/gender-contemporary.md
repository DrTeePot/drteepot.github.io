title: 2. Gender Theory - Contemporary
tag: gender-contemporary

---

Philosophy, science, and society have come a long way since the initial
theories of Aristotle and St. Augestine. Simone de Beauvior critiqued the old
Western men:

> Man vainly forgets that his anatomy also includes hormones and testicles. He
> grasps his body as a direct and normal link with the world that he believes
> he apprehends in all objectivity, whereas he considers woman's body an
> obstacle, a prison, burdened by everything that particularizes it. "The
> female is female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities," Aristotle said.
> "We should regard women's nature as suffering from natural defectiveness."
> And Saint Thomas in his turn decreed that woman was an "incomplete man," an
> "incidental" being. This is what the Genesis story symbolizes, where Eve
> appears as if drawn from Adam's "supernumerary" bone, in Bossuet's words.
> Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to
> himself; she is not considered an autonomous being.[^the-second-sex]

Discussions surrounding the philosophy of gender have come a long way since the
days of Aristotle and St. Augustine. Although historical interpretations of
gender have continued to broadly influence our culture, modern and contemporary
philosophers have expanded the discipline, providing more nuanced understandings
of human biology, psychology, and sociology. Looking at the works of Simone De
Beauvoir, Michael Foucault, Suzanne Kessler, Wendy McKenna, and Judith Butler we
will investigate:

* What is gender? Where does it come from?
* How do we understand claims of gender authenticity if there is no biological
dichotomy between sexes?
* Is gender natural or constructed, and what does this mean for contemporary
society?
* Do these questions even have a relevant answer in current society?

**Through our investigation, we will discover that theories of gender have been
varied, and that gender is viewed as a subjective experience of identity that is
created by repeated performances made by individuals.**

We’ve established that gender is a subjective experience that is constructed as
a sustained performance, but what does this mean for contemporary society?

Revisiting our initial questions going into this exploration:

* What is gender? Where does it come from?
* How do we understand claims of gender authenticity if there is no biological
dichotomy between sexes?
* Is gender natural or constructed, and what does this mean for contemporary
society?
* Do these questions have a relevant answer in current society?

We still don’t have a concrete answer to some of these, but perhaps the answers
are less relevant than we originally believed. How can we move forward where our
ideas of each other are not informed by our stereotypes of a particular role,
and be more intentional and thoughtful with our interactions?

Moving forward it is important to recognize that popularized ideas surrounding
gender are a disservice to society. We as a global community can do better, and
should work to bring an intersectional and progressive view of gender into more
mainstream view.

A more important consideration is if we are even capable of fully investigating
and changing the system. For those of us who live within the systems that we are
aiming to critique, we come to the question how we can have the knowledge to
critique it.

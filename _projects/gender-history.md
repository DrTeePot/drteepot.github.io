title: 1. Gender Theory - History
tag: gender-history

We, as a species, are obsessed with categorizing each other. Our propensity to
find patterns, and then classify those patterns is both an amazing survival
technique as well as a societal curse.

Of our many classifications, perhaps none is as relevant and hotly debated in
modern Western culture as the difference between men and women; why the
difference exists, how it's created, and what the implications of it are (if
any).

**The current ideas of gender in Western society, including the roles that we
assign to men and women have a deep and somewhat surprising history.** Some of
our ideas that we take for granted are thousands of years old, while others
are mere decades.

Beginning with Aristotle, I investigate the ways that our current ideas
of gender were formed, and the more modern and contemporary critiques of those
theories.

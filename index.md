I'm an agile developer and strategic governance enthusiast with a Bachelor of
Computer Science (Business Option) from the University of Waterloo.

I enjoy working on interdisciplinary teams to solve complex multi-faceted
problems, especially ones that involve the ways people interact and
communicate.

My community experience includes multiple directorships of non-profit and charitable
organizations, with a focus on the higher education industry.

Interested in building transparent and accessible systems.

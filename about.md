I am an agile developer and strategic governance enthusiast with a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo.

Through my time at the University of Waterloo, I have become an experienced director of multiple non-profit and charitable organizations, as well as skilled with a variety of operating systems and programming languages.

Subjects Iâ€™m interested in include:

- computer science,
- corporate governance,
- sociology, 
- philosophy.

In my free time, I also like to:

- ski,
- bike,
- play piano,
- read,
- practise my calligraphy, and
- watch TV shows and movies.

Feedback is a gift, so feel free to send any comments my way!

The story of humankind’s creation, as told in _Genesis I_ and _Genesis II_, is
another key way that our ideas of gender have been shaped in the last few
millennia.

## Two stories

There are many differences between _Genesis I_ and _Genesis II_, and there is
disagreement on whether they are two different creation stories or one. The
dicrepencies between the two stories is interesting, especially since the
language used in _Genesis II_ is often used to justify a hierarchy of the
sexes.

In the first narrative, we have a descriptive account of creation that begins
with light and space, moves to the animals, and ends with humankind.

> "So God created man in his own image; in the image of God he created him; male
> and female he created them."[^bible]
> 
> *Genesis I, 27*

In the _Genesis II_, the second account, we begin with a flood and move to the
creation of man and then the animals.

> "Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into
> his nostrils the breath of life. Thus the man became a living creature."[^bible]
>
> *Genesis II, 7*

> "Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will provide
> a partner for him.'"[^bible]
>
> *Genesis II, 18*

Noticing that man and women are created in two different stories, a naïve
understanding might be that God created the world twice; however, a
more nuanced investigation reveals that the first account came from nomads
almost 500 years before the second account (450 BCE vs 950 BCE).

## Two societies

These societies would find different values compelling, and would want
different creation stories because of their social structures.

**450 BCE - Nomadic society**
- Concerned with the ability for the land to produce plentiful and continuous
  food supplies.
- Smaller society, so formal power structures are less important. 
- Storytelling focusses on how things exist, and on the resources available to
  the society (descriptive).

**950 BCE - Agricultural society**
- Concerned with the ability to create and process large amounts of food for
  itself.
- Larger society, so formal power structures / heirarchy is needed to create
  order.
- Storytelling is an accessible way to communicate and maintain order in larger
  society.
- Focusses more on why society functions in a particular way (normative).

_Genesis II_ aims to provide a reasoning for a present reality --- it is
communicating why society is a particular way.

> "That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and
> the two become one flesh."[^bible]
>
> *Genesis II, 24*

> "this shall be called woman, for from man was this taken."[^bible]
>
> *Genesis II, 23*

_Genesis I_, in contrast, doesn't specify which sex was created first ("man" is
often used as a term for humankind in older literature). It only concerns
itself with the details of creation, and not the details of the human
condition.

The second story, however, is focused on the human condition; man is given the
power to name the rivers and lands, to categorize the world as he sees fit.  It
also has a justification for marriage, and for women to exist (to assist man in
the caretaking of Eden). This indicates that the second story is not meant as a
simple catalog of events, but is meant to convey a message to its readers.

## Biblically-justified patriarchy

Interpretations of the second story inform a staggering amount of literature
and societal ideas of gender. The power of naming is often given to those who
create and discover, and the power of naming that man is given implies the
dominion over Creation, and in particular Eve.

The dependence on Adam that is created when Eve is created from his rib is
poignant as well; God created Adam from dust, why was Eve different?

The use of the rib-bone and the dominion of naming are often used as key
reasons for men to be dominant and for women to be submissive.

## Appendix: Why does an omnipotent being need help?

Confusingly, _Genesis II_ brings into question God’s agency, God: 
- is unable to determine the things that Adam needs and wants, 
- gives Adam the power to dictate the direction of Creation, 
- is unable to create a suitable helper for Adam, a major justification for the
  use of Adams un-used rib-bone.

God works in mysterious ways, but the contrast with _Genesis I_ makes these
inconsistencies even more intriguing.

titled ["Gender: Flip the script"][flip-the-script-post]*

The idea that gender isn't tied to a persons biology is becoming more widely
accepted in society. This was first postulated by French philosopher [Simone De
Beauvoir][simone-post] in her work ["The Second Sex"][simone-de-beauvoir].
Building off of the work done by Beauvoir, [Judith
Butler][judith-butler][^judith-creds] expands this into the theory that gender
is a flexible and changing expression of the self, instead of a stable
identity.

[^judith-creds]: Butler is a [Fellow of the British Academy][british-academy]
    and a professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program
    of Critical Theory at the University of California, Berkeley.

## An ongoing performance 

In her model, our experience of gender as a fixed trait is an illusion
produced by repeating actions.

> gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an
> exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts.
>
> *(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp214)*

For example, a man might identify as "manly" which he believes leads him to do
traditionally masculine things. Butler suggests that the reverse is true; it's
the repeated manly actions (and the expectations of others that he act manly)
that gives him the sense he is a man.

## Regulating ourselves

> Discrete genders are part of what "humanizes" individuals within contemporary
> culture; indeed, we regularly punish those who fail to do their gender 
> right.

> (Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)

We use and regulate our bodies to convey our gender (among other things). In
this way, our bodies are a medium: [a channel (or mode) of communication and
artistic expression][medium-defn]. This medium is regulated politically and socially.

[medium-defn]: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/medium

Our bodies are politically regulated by the rules enforced by the state, for
example (non-exhaustive): 
- [clothing laws][dress-codes]
- limits to bodily modification like piercings
- bans or over-regulation on medical procedures like abortion, gender
  confirmation surgeries, or a hysterectomy/vasectomy (tube tying)
- guidelines for procedures like genital reshaping surgery on infants 
- taxes on necessary hygiene products like tampons
- the legality of the [gay and trans panic defense][gay-panic-defense]

[dress-codes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_laws_by_country
[gay-panic-defense]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense

Our bodies are socially regulated by the retribution we endure and expect from
other civilians. This includes  harrassment, assault, bullying, etc for
(non-exhaustive):
- wearing certain clothing
- having different mannerisms
- showing interest in the "wrong" gendered activities or hobbies

In Western society, we enforce the gender binary regularly, often ridiculing or
violently subduing/disciplining people who don't conform to societies
expectations of man/woman. One doesn't need to look far to see this; men who
act too feminine are often ridiculed and attacked, as are women who act too
masculine.[^recent]

[^recent]: A some-what continuous example of this is the [outrage][outrage]
    from main-stream media whenever a popular masculine figure wears a dress. A
    recent example is the cover of Vogue that features [Harry Styles wearing a
    white dress][white-dress]. More extremely, the [victimization rates for
    sexual and gender minorities][murder] are also much higher than the general
    population.

## "Natural" gender

Since it is essential to our safety and position in society, the performance of
gender must be consistent and repeated. Through
self-surveillance[^self-surveillance], we enforce the consistency and apparent
naturalism[^define-naturalism] (biological-ness) of our gender.

> Gender is […] a construction that regularly conceals its genesis; the tacit
> collective agreement to perform, produce, and sustain discrete and polar
> genders as cultural fictions is obscured by the credibility of those
> productions — and the punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them;
> the construction "compels" our belief in its necessity and
> naturalness.
> 
> *(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)*

The public enforcement of gender, combined with the conscious and unconscious
self-policing of our gender expressions leads to the regular, rigid, and
predictable expressions of "maleness" and "femaleness" that makes gender seem
biological, or as Butler often says, 'essential'.[^born-this-way]

In this way, the perception of a concrete and objective gender reality is
created by:
1. the constructed story of gender that we perform, combined with 
2. the ways that it is naturalized[^define-naturalism] and enforced by those
   around us.

[^self-surveillance]: Self surveillance is the act of monitoring and adjusting
    our own behaviour due to the possibility that another person might be
    watching.

    This is demonstrated in the architectural design of the
    [Panopticon][wiki-panopticon], which can be used as a metaphor for the
    self-consciousness of our current society.

[^define-naturalism]: Naturalism in this case is referring to metaphysical
    naturalism, which is the argument that a trait ["related to consciousness
    and the mind are reducible to, or supervene upon, nature."][wiki-naturalism]

    In this case we are making a distinction between a biological trait
    and a sociological one.

[^born-this-way]: Sometimes, the term "born this way" is used as an argument
    for people's rights. This is ultimately a mistake. Instead of basing
    rights on whether something is "natural," we should listen and do our best
    to understand each other -- regardless of our ability to explain or relate to
    those experiences within our own personal realities.

## In a nutshell

Butler argues that gender is a changing expression of self, instead of being a
stable part of someone identity. Gender is a performance that we use to
communicate with the people around us (i.e. the construction of gender). We use our
bodies (which are a politically and socially regulated medium) as the
essential prop to convey our gender.

If we are "bad at gender" we are punished and policed by ourselves and others
to fulfil the gendered expectations of Western society. Avoiding this
punishment causes gender to be a repeated performance that creates predictable
expressions of gender that appear biological (or "essential"). These [everyday
forms of gender expression position us][kessler-post] (by
ourselves and others) in the Western gender hierarchy.

Overall the wording is very academic, and potentially not accessible to someone
who doesn't study gender. Define naturalism. Arguments jump around a lot.
self surveillance.


[Judith Butler][judith-butler][^judith-creds] builds off of
previous research to build a theory of gender as a flexible and changing
expression of the self, as opposed to a stable identity. 

## An ongoing performance 

In her model, our experiences of gender as a fixed attribute is built by
repeated actions, which creates the illusion that gender is a stable identity
when it might be better viewed as an expression of self that changes.
In other words, gender is a subjective construction that we repeatedly create
in time, not a fixed objective reality of our experiences.

> exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts. [^gender-trouble]
>
> *(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp214)*

These constructions are expressed as a performance that we demonstrate for
others using our bodies (a politically and socially regulated medium). They
signify our position in a gender hierarchy and the roles that we take on.

This performance must be repeated, and our self-surveillance and enforcement
ensures its consistency and apparent naturalism.

> the construction "compels" our belief in its necessity and
> naturalness.[^gender-trouble]

> *(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)*

**Recap**: The perception of a concrete and objective gender reality is created
by the constructed story of gender that we perform, combined with the ways that
it is naturalized and enforced.

## Appearance of naturalism

As a society, we enforce these ideas regularly, often ridiculing or violently
subduing people who don't conform to the expectations of Western society.

> Discrete genders are part of what "humanizes" individuals within contemporary
> culture; indeed, we regularly punish those who fail to do their gender 
> right. [^gender-trouble]
>
> (Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)

The enforcement of gender, combined with the unconscious (or sometimes more
intentional) self-policing of our gender expressions, lead to the regular,
rigid, and predictable expressions of gender that make it seem biological.

## What about "Born this way"?

Whether or not gender is a biological phenomenon or a societal/personal one
should not determine how we treat each other. Peoples personal realities and
subjective experiences are real, and we should listen and do our best to
understand each other regardless of our ability to explain the experiences with
medicine.

ago, I started to create a framework in [Golang](https://golang.org) for developing 3-dimensional real-time applications (for example, a game) using pseudo-functional concepts instead of the object-oriented style that is commonly used. It was a cool learning project that got put aside, but after thinking about it for the last eight months I wanted to pick it up and share some thoughts on how it will be designed in the future.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAn application framework often provides a number of systems as well as a method to connect these systems. Traditionally [in games, these systems follow an architectural pattern](https://shaneenishry.com/blog/2014/12/27/misconceptions-of-component-based-entity-systems/) called [Entity-Component-System (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–component–system). \\n\\nThis project will follow similar principles to ECS and [data oriented design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-oriented_design), using lessons learned from [Redux](https://redux.js.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org) to create a comprehensive application framework in [Golang](https://golang.org).\\n\\n## Areas of Concern\\n\\nThe project will have the following major components:\\n\\n- Architecture: provides utilities to maintain application state over time \\n- Rendering engine: displays visual output on a user’s screen \\n- Audio engine: plays sounds for the user \\n- Rules engine: allows developers to create common triggers that will send actions over time\\n- Artificial intelligence engine: provides utilities to allow entities to make complex decisions\\n- Scripting engine: an interface so users can add custom behaviour to an application\\n\\nThese components are distinct and mutually exclusive; they can be composed together to implement the application logic.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nThe architecture system is the part of the framework that is commonly handled by an ECS library.\\n\\nThe architecture system will be inspired by Redux and how it handles state, which means that it will follow the core three principles of Redux. These principles are to ensure that:\\n\\nThe architecture system will be inspired by Redux and how it handles state, which means that it will follow the [three principles of Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html). These principles are to ensure that:\\n- there is a single source of truth,\\n- state is read-only, and\\n- changes are made with pure functions.\\n\\nAccording to these principles, the developer will emit stateless objects called actions to update state. These actions will be processed by a pure function called a reducer, which will update the application's state. The reducer will accept the current state and an action as parameters, and will return the new state object.\\n\\nSince creating a large function to handle all of the application logic is impractical, multiple pure functions with the same signature will be combined to create the core reducing functionality.\\n\\nEntities (stand-alone objects within the application) will be created by combining components, some of which will be connected to the global state. Components will define which parts of the application state they need, and will have methods that dispatch actions on certain events.\\n\\nNotably, components will not have local state. Components will be updated when changes to application state happen that affect the parts of state they are subscribed to.\\n\\nFor example, to change an object's 3-dimensional coordinates, an action could be emitted that will have an object-identifier and the new coordinates. A reducer will then modify the object’s coordinates in the global state, and the component that is subscribed to changes on that ID will update, triggering a re-render.\\n\\n## Render and Audio Systems\\n\\nThese systems will integrate with OpenGL to provide the basic functionality of rendering and playing sounds. They will largely consist of functions to modify the rendering pipeline.\\n\\nThis needs to handle:\\n\\n- importing 3D objects (meshes)\\n- creating [particle systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_system)\\n- creating lights\\n- [rendering meshes](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Rendering)\\n- performing specific mathematical operations ([transformations](https://open.gl/transformations))\\n- creating and modifying [shaders](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Shader)\\n- playing sounds\\n\\n## Rules System (Physics)\\n\\nThis will provide an interface to add various properties to an object, which will be acted upon in each frame. These properties will largely be used to define the physical properties and movement of objects, but could also be used to create logic around other updating systems like plant growth. This will involve sending large amounts of actions to the application state object, so the sending and modification of state will need to be very efficient.\\n\\n## Everything Else\\n\\nThe other components of the framework will be considered when the need arises, but until then they are peripheral.\\n\\n## In Conclusion\\n\\nThis is likely a very bad idea, since Golang is not designed for the demands of a real-time rendering framework. The project is mainly a fun proof-of-concept and learning initiative. Many of the decisions outlined in this document may change as development on this project continues, as I have written very little code to enforce these ideas; however, I look forward to seeing where it takes me.

One of the most discussed and relevant debates, continuing even today, has been on the differentiation of men and women, how that difference is created, and what the implications of it are. **The current gendered roles in Western society that we assign to men and women have a deep history, and the ways that the ideas of Western philosophers from thousands of years ago still effect society is astonishing.** Beginning with Aristotle, we will investigate the ways that our current ideas of gender were formed, and the ways we can be critical of them.\\n\\n--- \\n\\n# Aristotle’s Thoughts\\n\\nAristotle began philosophizing about the nature of the difference between men and women based off the works of previous philosophers. He was mainly looking for a way to determine the ways that men and women are of the same species and the extent that they are different.\\n\\n>  “It is however not agreed whether one is male and another female even before the difference is plain to our senses”[^aristotle]\\n> *Aristotle, Generation of Animals, IV, pp371*\\n\\nPhilosophers and scientists originally hypothesized that all differences were caused by changes in energy (or temperature). Heat caused transformations (destruction, reproduction, etc.) whereas cold caused things to stagnate and slow down. This was vaguely along the same elemental (earth, wind, fire, water) rubrics that were also in use.\\n\\n[![Model of Aristolean Science](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Aristotle%27s_model_of_Inheritance.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_genetics)\\n*(By Chiswick Chap (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], via Wikimedia Commons)*\\n\\nUsing this framework, Aristotle theorized that there is a perfect definition for each object in reality, and that the reality consisted of mostly-imperfect replicas of that form (a theory called hylomorphism). Aristotle believed that differences in function caused entities to have an alternative definition or form from each other. Aristotle investigated the variations between the the fluids men and women produced as a starting point for his theories on the differentiation of sex.\\n\\nMost scholars of the time thought that menstrual blood/fluid was the female equivalent to semen. Since all differences are related to hot and cold, they thought that menstrual fluid must be cold whereas semen was hot, which would make them the same in form (definition), but different in reality (matter). Aristotle built off this work to try and determine what made these two fluids different.\\n\\nAristotle came to the conclusion that men and women did not differ in their functions, but only by accident of creation. He accepted there are differences within male and female, but believed they were due to imperfections in the ways that people are born. Since the prevailing thought at the time was that the function of humankind was to reproduce, this meant that the men with their hot semen (who controlled reproduction) were more perfect replicas of the perfect form of a human.\\n\\nThese “accidents of creation” were thus due to the heat that was available during procreation. If a man had children that looked exactly like them, that meant that the father was viral and hot; in other words, the man could exact his will on creation. It is noteworthy that Aristotle’s theories allowed for men to have variable will-power, such that a man could have a perfect child one time but imperfect (female) the next. \\n\\nThe idea that women are an imperfect version of men and that men are the aggressive decision makers of creation is a narrative that is propagated in our current day. The idea that men are naturally aggressive, that they control reproduction, and that the sperm fight for the egg are all ideas that stem from Aristotle’s original ideas about sex. \\n\\nHowever, there is an obvious loophole in his theory: men can recreate a perfect form through enforcing their will on nature, but women cannot enforce their will in any way to pass on their genetics (because they do not have the ability to produce semen). The difference between the ability to procreate and the inability to procreate is a major difference in function, which is a difference in form.\\n\\nDespite the flaws in this theory, students are still taught about the aggressive nature of sperm and the passivity of the egg (despite research to the contrary); women are still thought to have little control over reproduction, and the one sex model still influences modern ideas of medication and treatment.\\n\\n# Bible - Genesis; Two make one\\n\\nThe story of humankind’s creation contained in Genesis I and II is another key way that our ideas of gender have been shaped in the last few millennia. \\n\\nIn the first narrative, we have a descriptive account of creation that begins with light and space, moves to the animals, and ends with humankind.\\n\\n> “So God created man in his own image; in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.”[^Bible]\\n> *(Genesis I, 27)*\\n\\nIn the Genesis II, the second account, we begin with a flood and move to the creation of man and then the animals.\\n\\n> “Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. Thus the man became a living creature.”[^Bible] \\n> *(Genesis II, 7)*\\n\\n> \\\"Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone. I will provide a partner for him.'”[^Bible] \\n> *(Genesis II, 18)*\\n\\nNoticing that these are the same events of creation, we can look at the ways these stories were told and when to better inform our understanding. A naïve understanding is that God created the world twice; however, a more nuanced investigation reveals that the first account came from nomads almost 500 years before the second account (450 BCE vs 950 BCE). \\n\\nThe difference in timing is important because of the values that these societies would have been interested in: the first was a nomadic society concerned with the ability for the land to produce plentiful and continuous food supplies. The second account comes from a society more interested in agriculture and the ability to create large amounts of food for itself.\\n\\nWe can also notice the difference in framing. The first account is a descriptive one, whereas the second story is much more normative; it aims to provide a reasoning for the way things are. \\n\\n> “That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and the two become one flesh.”[^Bible] \\n> *(Genesis II, 24)*\\n\\n> “this shall be called woman, for from man was this taken.”[^Bible] \\n> *(Genesis II, 23)*\\n\\nNotice how the first account does not specify which sex was created first, it simply states that two sexes were created (“man” is often used as a term for humankind in older literature). As well, it only concerns itself with the details of creation, and not the details of the human condition. \\n\\nAlternatively, the second story is focused on the human condition; man is given the power to name the rivers and lands, to categorize the world as he sees fit. It also has a justification for marriage, and for women to exist (to assist man in the caretaking of Eden). This indicates that the second story is not meant as a simple catalog of events, but is meant to convey a message to its readers.\\n\\nThis difference, and the interpretations of the second story, inform a staggering amount of literature and societal ideas of gender. The power of naming is often given to those who create and discover, and the power of naming that man is given implies the dominion over the creatures, and in particular Eve. The dependence on Adam that is created when Eve is created from his rib is poignant as well; if God could create Adam from dust, why did God not do the same for Eve? \\n\\nFinally, the second story brings into question God’s agency. God is seemingly unable to determine the things that Adam needs and wants, and gives Adam large power to dictate the direction of Creation. Additionally, God is unable to create a suitable helper for Adam, which is one of the reasons that is given for God’s need to use Adams un-used rib-bone. The use of the rib-bone and the dominion of naming are used as key reasons for men to be dominant and for women to be submissive. \\n\\n# St Augustine and St. Thomas: Resolving tension\\n\\nAs we have seen in Genesis II, women are portrayed as the helpers of man. \\n\\n>  \\\"that man is the image of god, but the woman is the glory of the man\\\" [^Clack] \\n>  *Augustine 354–430, On the Trinity ChVII, pp814*\\n\\nSt. Augustine was confused by this, particularly the idea that head-dressings were seen as a terrible barrier between man’s rational thought and God. If men and women were of the same form, as claimed by Aristotle, then they should have equal access to rational thought and equal access to God’s grace; why don’t the rules around head-dress apply to men and women equally?\\n\\n> “But because they are there renewed after the image of God, where there is no sex; man is there made after the image of God, where there is no sex, that is, in the spirit of his mind.”[^Clack]\\n> *Augustine 354–430, On the Trinity ChVII, pp816*\\n\\nThis disparity arises because Paul's policy on why men should act in a certain way is based on form, from the first Genesis story, whereas his policy on how women should be treated is based on matter, from the second Genesis story.\\n\\nSt. Augestine's decides to reconcile this by creating a theory of mind where there are two parts; the eternal mind and the everyday mind. Thus the material man represents the eternal mind from the human form, and women represents the everyday mind of the human form. Together, their minds create a complete human mind.\\n\\nSt Augestine thought that if we view men and women separately, man is more perfect. While women have the capability to think rationally, when we look at how women on their own and men on their own act on the day-to-day, what do they represent? Women in that day tended to do more every-day chores like tending to the house and family, whereas upper-class men were  often more occupied with higher thought. Using his observations of women who are divorced from heterosexual relationships, they are of the same form but embody only the everyday mind and are thus inferior. \\n\\nBeing more critical, if women are always discussed in terms of bodies, and men in minds, this leads to greater observation of imperfection in body, including perceived dirtiness. \\n\\nThe idea that St. Augustine introduced begin to indicate the idea of mind/body dualism, the divide between rationality and emotion, and the heteronormativity that implies men and women (and not any other gender pairing) are required for individuals to be complete.  \\n\\nAnother major figure in our understandings of gender is St. Thomas Aquinas, who wrote a of law and training manuals for the Catholic Church. \\n\\nSt. Thomas reinforced the ideas of St. Augustine and Aristotle by hypothesizing that women were an ”incomplete man,\\\" and an \\\"incidental being”. His theory of law stated that human law was an extension of natural law, and that divine law was found through revelation. \\n\\nObservations of dirtiness and the explicit classification of women as having “everyday” instead of higher thinking ability is also the beginning of the Idea that women fall short of what they are supposed to be able to do for naturalistic reasons. Today, we often see arguments of biological determinism (that a person is defined solely by their biology) used to justify the different ways we treat men and women in society, and these arguments have their grounding in the ideas of form and matter that St. Augustine uses to justify the teaching of the apostle Paul.\\n\\nOver 4.5 billion people take the words of these major figures in Abrahamic religious history as their starting point for thinking about gender and sex, which is roughly 4.65 billion people, and others are affected by association. Even fields that are meant to be free from religious impact feel the impact. An example is the ways that biology frames the process of insemination as an aggressive act by sperm towards a passive egg, when in fact there is a large amount of research to say that the egg performs a much larger role in determining the successful sperm.\\n\\n# Simone Beauvoir: The Feminine Reality\\n\\nPhilosophy, science, and society have come a long way since the initial theories of Aristotle and St. Augestine. Simone de Beauvior critiqued the old Western men:\\n\\n> “Man vainly forgets that his anatomy also includes hormones and testicles. He grasps his body as a direct and normal link with the world that he believes he apprehends in all objectivity, whereas he considers woman's body an obstacle, a prison, burdened by everything that particularizes it. \\\"The female is female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities,\\\" Aristotle said. \\\"We should regard women's nature as suffering from natural defectiveness.\\\" And Saint Thomas in his turn decreed that woman was an \\\"incomplete man,\\\" an \\\"incidental\\\" being. This is what the Genesis story symbolizes, where Eve appears as if drawn from Adam's \\\"supernumerary\\\" bone, in Bossuet's words.

He accepted there are differences within male and female, but believed they were due to imperfections in the ways that people are born.

The difference between the ability to procreate and the inability to procreate is a major difference in function, which is a difference in form.</p>\n<p>Despite the flaws in this theory, students are still taught about the aggressive nature of sperm and the passivity of the egg (despite research to the contrary); women are still thought to have little control over reproduction, and the one sex model still influences modern ideas of medication and treatment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"biblegenesistwomakeone\">Bible - Genesis; Two make one</h1>\n<p>The story of humankind’s creation contained in Genesis I and II is another key way that our ideas of gender have been shaped in the last few millennia.</p>\n<p>In the first narrative, we have a descriptive account of creation that begins with light and space, moves to the animals, and ends with humankind.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“So God created man in his own image; in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup><br>\n<em>(Genesis I, 27)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Genesis II, the second account, we begin with a flood and move to the creation of man and then the animals.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.

A naïve understanding is that God created the world twice; however, a more nuanced investigation reveals that the first account came from nomads almost 500 years before the second account (450 BCE vs 950 BCE).</p>\n<p>The difference in timing is important because of the values that these societies would have been interested in: the first was a nomadic society concerned with the ability for the land to produce plentiful and continuous food supplies. The second account comes from a society more interested in agriculture and the ability to create large amounts of food for itself.</p>\n<p>We can also notice the difference in framing. The first account is a descriptive one, whereas the second story is much more normative; it aims to provide a reasoning for the way things are.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and the two become one flesh.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2:3\">[2:3]</a></sup><br>\n<em>(Genesis II, 24)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“this shall be called woman, for from man was this taken.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2:4\">[2:4]</a></sup><br>\n<em>(Genesis II, 23)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice how the first account does not specify which sex was created first, it simply states that two sexes were created (“man” is often used as a term for humankind in older literature). As well, it only concerns itself with the details of creation, and not the details of the human condition.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the second story is focused on the human condition; man is given the power to name the rivers and lands, to categorize the world as he sees fit. It also has a justification for marriage, and for women to exist (to assist man in the caretaking of Eden). This indicates that the second story is not meant as a simple catalog of events, but is meant to convey a message to its readers.</p>\n<p>This difference, and the interpretations of the second story, inform a staggering amount of literature and societal ideas of gender. The power of naming is often given to those who create and discover, and the power of naming that man is given implies the dominion over the creatures, and in particular Eve. The dependence on Adam that is created when Eve is created from his rib is poignant as well; if God could create Adam from dust, why did God not do the same for Eve?</p>\n<p>Finally, the second story brings into question God’s agency. God is seemingly unable to determine the things that Adam needs and wants, and gives Adam large power to dictate the direction of Creation. Additionally, God is unable to create a suitable helper for Adam, which is one of the reasons that is given for God’s need to use Adams un-used rib-bone. The use of the rib-bone and the dominion of naming are used as key reasons for men to be dominant and for women to be submissive.</p>\n<h1 id=\"staugustineandstthomasresolvingtension\">St Augustine and St. Thomas: Resolving tension</h1>\n<p>As we have seen in Genesis II, women are portrayed as the helpers of man.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;that man is the image of god, but the woman is the glory of the man&quot; <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup><br>\n<em>Augustine 354–430, On the Trinity ChVII, pp814</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>St. Augustine was confused by this, particularly the idea that head-dressings were seen as a terrible barrier between man’s rational thought and God.

Using his observations of women who are divorced from heterosexual relationships, they are of the same form but embody only the everyday mind and are thus inferior.</p>\n<p>Being more critical, if women are always discussed in terms of bodies, and men in minds, this leads to greater observation of imperfection in body, including perceived dirtiness.</p>\n<p>The idea that St. Augustine introduced begin to indicate the idea of mind/body dualism, the divide between rationality and emotion, and the heteronormativity that implies men and women (and not any other gender pairing) are required for individuals to be complete.</p>\n<p>Another major figure in our understandings of gender is St. Thomas Aquinas, who wrote a of law and training manuals for the Catholic Church.</p>\n<p>St. Thomas reinforced the ideas of St. Augustine and Aristotle by hypothesizing that women were an ”incomplete man,&quot; and an &quot;incidental being”.

Today, we often see arguments of biological determinism (that a person is defined solely by their biology) used to justify the different ways we treat men and women in society, and these arguments have their grounding in the ideas of form and matter that St. Augustine uses to justify the teaching of the apostle Paul.</p>\n<p>Over 4.5 billion people take the words of these major figures in Abrahamic religious history as their starting point for thinking about gender and sex, which is roughly 4.65 billion people, and others are affected by association.

Although historical interpretations of gender have continued to broadly influence our culture, modern and contemporary philosophers have expanded the discipline, providing more nuanced understandings of human biology, psychology, and sociology. Looking at the works of Simone De Beauvoir, Michael Foucault, Suzanne Kessler, Wendy McKenna, and Judith Butler we will investigate:\\n\\n- What is gender? Where does it come from?\\n- How do we understand claims of gender authenticity if there is no biological dichotomy between sexes?\\n- Is gender natural or constructed, and what does this mean for contemporary society? \\n- Do these questions even have a relevant answer in current society?   \\n\\n**Through our investigation, we will discover that theories of gender have been varied, and that gender is viewed as a subjective experience of identity that is created by repeated performances made by individuals.**\\n\\n--- \\n\\n# Simone De Beauvoir – what is women?\\n\\nBeauvoir challenges the ways that societies of primarily-male Western philosophers have characterized ideas of gender, specifically their restrictive definitions of femininity. These philosophers largely viewed women as imperfect versions of men, and classified men as practically divine and supremely logical beings operating beyond their mortal coils. Beauvoir criticizes these outdated theories: \\n\\n> “Man vainly forgets that his anatomy also includes hormones and testicles. He grasps his body as a direct and normal link with the world that he believes he apprehends in all objectivity, whereas he considers woman's body an obstacle, a prison, burdened by everything that particularizes it.”[^secondsex]\\n> *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*\\n\\nBeauvoir supports her claims by referencing the works of classical philosophers, demonstrating the ways that masculine superiority has impacted large schools of thought:\\n\\n- Aristotle, a famous philosopher who continues to have influence in modern philosophy, stated that “the female is female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities, […] we should regard women's nature as suffering from natural defectiveness.”[^secondsex] *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*\\n- Saint Thomas, whose influenced the Catholic church, declared that women were an \\\"incomplete man,\\\" and an \\\"incidental\\\" being.[^secondsex] *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*\\n- Many interpretations of Genesis II, where the creation of Eve from Adam’s redundant and extraneous rib-bone is taken to symbolize reliance and submission. \\n\\nBeauvoir concludes that ancient philosophers have defined men as the default, and women are merely an object that is considered in relation to men; not as an individual. \\n\\n> “Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself; she is not considered an autonomous being.”[^secondsex]\\n> *(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)*\\n\\nRecognizing that femininity has been historically defined as distinctly not masculine is important to understand the idea of femininity (and gender in general) as an identifying trait. If our definition for a gender is the lack of another identifier, we run into issues of categorization. What does it mean to be a women if womanhood is simply not-manhood? What about men who do not conform to the [hegemonic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hegemony) ideas of masculinity? What does it mean to identify as a man, and subsequently as a non-man? These historical ideas about gender don’t help us to understand people’s experiences.\\n\\n# Kessler and McKenna – the subjective categorization of gender\\n\\nThe importance of determining another person’s gender is observed by Kessler and McKenna in their work “The Primacy of Gender Attribution.” They argue that we assign gender and make assumptions about people based off of our assignment before all other actions, and that we retroactively justify our attribution instead of making the attribution based on a defined criterion. \\n\\n> “Part of being a socialized member of a group is knowing the rules for giving acceptable evidence for categorization.” [^kessler]\\n> *(Kessler and McKenna, Gender: an ethnomethodological approach, pp6)*\\n   \\nIdentification of another’s gender is key for our understanding of their roles, as well as how to interact with them, what to expect from them, and how to interpret their actions. These roles and the primacy of gender attribution are taught through a variety of social institutions, including religion, school, parents, etc. and inform our actions from an early age. They note that when an individual’s gender is perceived as ambiguous, other people often showed signs of unease as they tried to place the individual into a gender category.[^kessler]\\n\\n> “The primacy of gender attribution becomes obvious when we recognize that assignment and identity can be seen as special cases of attribution, and, even more importantly, that in order to meaningfully interpret someone's assignment, identity, and role, and the relationship among them, one must first attribute gender.”[^kessler] \\n> *(Kessler and McKenna, Gender: an ethnomethodological approach, pp17)*\\n\\nMany subscribe to the assumption that all things have an objective truth, including the human experience. This notion uses the gender binary as a tool to categorize within reality. However making these assumptions and attempting construct other experiences within an objective view of reality is inherently flawed, since experiences are by definition subjective and require interpretation from the perceiver.\\n\\nThe idea that gender is a core and stable part of someone’s identity comes from the assumption that all things have an objective truth, including the human experience. This notion uses the gender binary as a tool to categorize within reality. However, making these assumptions and attempting to construct human experience within an objective view of reality is inherently flawed, since experiences are by definition subjective and require interpretation from the perceiver.\\n\\n> “A defining feature of reality construction is to see our world as being the only possible one.” [^kessler] \\n> *(Kessler and McKenna, Gender: an ethnomethodological approach, pp18)*\\n\\n## Judith Butler – Gender as a performance\\n\\n[Judith Butler](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/judith-butler), a Fellow of the [British Academy](https://www.britac.ac.uk/) and a professor in the Department of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory at the University of California, Berkeley, builds off of the works of those before her. She uses previous research and conclusions to form a theory on societal experiences of gender as a repeated performance that creates our ideas of gender as a stable identity when it might be better viewed as an expression of self that changes in time.\\n\\n> \\\"Gender ought not to be construed as a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts follow; rather, gender is an identity tenuously constituted in time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts.\\\"[^buttler]\\n> (Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp214) \\n\\nIn her work, Butler argues that gender is a construction that we create through time, not a fixed objective reality of our experiences. These constructions are expressed as a performance that we demonstrate for others using a politically and socially regulated medium (our bodies), signifying our position in a gender hierarchy and the roles that we take on. This performance must be repeated, and our self-surveillance and enforcement ensures its consistency and apparent naturalism. \\n\\n\\\"Gender is […] a construction that regularly conceals its genesis; the tacit collective agreement to perform, produce, and sustain discrete and polar genders as cultural fictions is obscured by the credibility of those productions— and the punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them; the construction \\\"compels\\\" our belief in its necessity and naturalness.\\\"[^buttler]\\n> (Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)\\n\\nThe belief in the constructed story of gender that we perform, and the ways that it is naturalized and enforced have created the perception of a concrete objective reality, and as a society we enforce these ideas regularly. \\n\\n> \\\"Discrete genders are part of what \\\"humanizes\\\" individuals within contemporary culture; indeed, we regularly punish those who fail to do their gender right.\\\"[^buttler]\\n> (Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)\\n \\n# Michael Foucault – who decides the categories?\\n\\nWhen discussing the power of characterization and categorization it is important to discuss the works of Michael Foucault, a French philosopher that is primarily known for his ideas around the ways humans categorize things, and how that power manifests itself in the ways people interact with each other. His work on categorization and power structures is used in many fields including psychology and sociology. \\n\\nOur exploration of gender begins to concern Foucault’s when we begin to question the ways that gender is a categorization of behaviour that influences how we expect people to act and the ways that we act around others.\\n\\nWithout the concept of categorization, no mechanism of classification or description would be present.\\n\\n> “…one that does not distribute the multiplicity of existing things into any of the categories that make it possible for us to name, speak, and think.\\\"[^foucault]\\n> *(Foucault, The order of things: an archaeology of the human sciences, XIX)*\\n\\nGiven the importance of categorization as a method of describing differences and communicating concepts, what does this mean for gender? Historically, Western society recognizes two genders, which are rationalized using naturalistic arguments. We can see in the historical record the factors and power dynamics that lead Western society to settle on two, and the ways naturalistic arguments were constructed to support this idea. Comparatively, modern theorists also have records of other societies that use more than two categories, providing a counter-example to any naturalistic arguments.\\n\\nThe way gender categories are formed in different societies is an area of particular interest. Why is it that Western society continues to frame its populations in terms of two genders, despite growing [research](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/10930654/Facebooks-71-gender-options-come-to-UK-users.html) on and [support](http://time.com/4703058/time-cover-story-beyond-he-or-she/) for intersex, trans*, and gender queer people who did not fit into these categories?\\n\\nThe story of Western gender constructs is largely informed by the power dynamics of society. The individuals in power have the power to manipulate the categorizations we use, whether they be church officials like St Thomas Aquinas, educators and popular philosophizes like Aristotle, or the people around us who may rely our actions to an authority or someone whom we respect. As we are all enforcing, attributing, and assuming each others genders, we are all partially responsible for perpetuating and normalizing the ideas of gender that are often perceived to be objective truths.\\n\\n# Where do we go now? \\n\\nWe’ve established that gender is a subjective experience that is constructed as a sustained performance, but what does this mean for contemporary society? \\n\\nRevisiting our initial questions going into this exploration: \\n\\n- What is gender? Where does it come from?\\n- How do we understand claims of gender authenticity if there is no biological dichotomy between sexes?\\n- Is gender natural or constructed, and what does this mean for contemporary society? \\n- Do these questions have a relevant answer in current society?\\n\\nWe still don’t have a concrete answer to some of these, but perhaps the answers are less relevant than we originally believed. How can we move forward where our ideas of each other are not informed by our stereotypes of a particular role, and be more intentional and thoughtful with our interactions?\\n\\nMoving forward it is important to recognize that popularized ideas surrounding gender are a disservice to society. We as a global community can do better, and should work to bring an intersectional and progressive view of gender into more mainstream view.  \\n\\nA more important consideration is if we are even capable of fully investigating and changing the system. For those of us who live within the systems that we are aiming to critique, we come to the question how we can have the knowledge to critique it. \\n\\n> “What does it mean when the tools of a racist patriarchy are used to examine the fruits of that same patriarchy?

He\ngrasps his body as a direct and normal link with the world that he believes he\napprehends in all objectivity, whereas he considers woman's body an obstacle, a\nprison, burdened by everything that particularizes it.”[1]\n(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)\n\nBeauvoir supports her claims by referencing the works of classical philosophers,\ndemonstrating the ways that masculine superiority has impacted large schools of\nthought:\n\n * Aristotle, a famous philosopher who continues to have influence in modern\n   philosophy, stated that “the female is female by virtue of a certain lack of\n   qualities, […] we should regard women's nature as suffering from natural\n   defectiveness.”[1:1]  (De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)\n * Saint Thomas, whose influenced the Catholic church, declared that women were\n   an \"incomplete man,\" and an \"incidental\" being.[1:2]  (De Beauvoir, The\n   second sex, pp2014)\n * Many interpretations of Genesis II, where the creation of Eve from Adam’s\n   redundant and extraneous rib-bone is taken to symbolize reliance and\n   submission.\n\nBeauvoir concludes that ancient philosophers have defined men as the default,\nand women are merely an object that is considered in relation to men; not as an\nindividual.\n\n“Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to\nhimself; she is not considered an autonomous being.”[1:3]\n(De Beauvoir, The second sex, pp2014)\n\nRecognizing that femininity has been historically defined as distinctly not\nmasculine is important to understand the idea of femininity (and gender in\ngeneral) as an identifying trait. If our definition for a gender is the lack of\nanother identifier, we run into issues of categorization. What does it mean to\nbe a women if womanhood is simply not-manhood? What about men who do not conform\nto the hegemonic [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hegemony]  ideas of\nmasculinity? What does it mean to identify as a man, and subsequently as a\nnon-man? These historical ideas about gender don’t help us to understand\npeople’s experiences.\n\nKessler and McKenna – the subjective categorization of gender\nThe importance of determining another person’s gender is observed by Kessler and\nMcKenna in their work “The Primacy of Gender Attribution.” They argue that we\nassign gender and make assumptions about people based off of our assignment\nbefore all other actions, and that we retroactively justify our attribution\ninstead of making the attribution based on a defined criterion.\n\n“Part of being a socialized member of a group is knowing the rules for giving\nacceptable evidence for categorization.” [2]\n(Kessler and McKenna, Gender: an ethnomethodological approach, pp6)\n\nIdentification of another’s gender is key for our understanding of their roles,\nas well as how to interact with them, what to expect from them, and how to\ninterpret their actions. These roles and the primacy of gender attribution are\ntaught through a variety of social institutions, including religion, school,\nparents, etc. and inform our actions from an early age. They note that when an\nindividual’s gender is perceived as ambiguous, other people often showed signs\nof unease as they tried to place the individual into a gender category.[2:1]\n\n“The primacy of gender attribution becomes obvious when we recognize that\nassignment and identity can be seen as special cases of attribution, and, even\nmore importantly, that in order to meaningfully interpret someone's assignment,\nidentity, and role, and the relationship among them, one must first attribute\ngender.”[2:2]\n(Kessler and McKenna, Gender: an ethnomethodological approach, pp17)\n\nMany subscribe to the assumption that all things have an objective truth,\nincluding the human experience. This notion uses the gender binary as a tool to\ncategorize within reality. However making these assumptions and attempting\nconstruct other experiences within an objective view of reality is inherently\nflawed, since experiences are by definition subjective and require\ninterpretation from the perceiver.\n\nThe idea that gender is a core and stable part of someone’s identity comes from\nthe assumption that all things have an objective truth, including the human\nexperience. This notion uses the gender binary as a tool to categorize within\nreality. However, making these assumptions and attempting to construct human\nexperience within an objective view of reality is inherently flawed, since\nexperiences are by definition subjective and require interpretation from the\nperceiver.\n\n“A defining feature of reality construction is to see our world as being the\nonly possible one.” [2:3]\n(Kessler and McKenna, Gender: an ethnomethodological approach, pp18)\n\nJudith Butler – Gender as a performance\nJudith Butler [https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/judith-butler], a Fellow\nof the British Academy [https://www.britac.ac.uk/]  and a professor in the\nDepartment of Comparative Literature and the Program of Critical Theory at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, builds off of the works of those before her.\nShe uses previous research and conclusions to form a theory on societal\nexperiences of gender as a repeated performance that creates our ideas of gender\nas a stable identity when it might be better viewed as an expression of self\nthat changes in time.\n\n\"Gender ought not to be construed as a stable identity or locus of agency from\nwhich various acts follow; rather, gender is an identity tenuously constituted\nin time, instituted in an exterior space through a stylized repetition of acts.\"\n\n[3]\n(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp214)\n\nIn her work, Butler argues that gender is a construction that we create through\ntime, not a fixed objective reality of our experiences. These constructions are\nexpressed as a performance that we demonstrate for others using a politically\nand socially regulated medium (our bodies), signifying our position in a gender\nhierarchy and the roles that we take on. This performance must be repeated, and\nour self-surveillance and enforcement ensures its consistency and apparent\nnaturalism.\n\n\"Gender is […] a construction that regularly conceals its genesis; the tacit\ncollective agreement to perform, produce, and sustain discrete and polar genders\nas cultural fictions is obscured by the credibility of those productions— and\nthe punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them; the construction\n\"compels\" our belief in its necessity and naturalness.\"[3:1]\n\n(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)\n\nThe belief in the constructed story of gender that we perform, and the ways that\nit is naturalized and enforced have created the perception of a concrete\nobjective reality, and as a society we enforce these ideas regularly.\n\n\"Discrete genders are part of what \"humanizes\" individuals within contemporary\nculture; indeed, we regularly punish those who fail to do their gender right.\"\n[3:2]\n(Butler, Gender trouble: Subjects of sex/gender/desire, pp213)\n\nMichael Foucault – who decides the categories?\nWhen discussing the power of characterization and categorization it is important\nto discuss the works of Michael Foucault, a French philosopher that is primarily\nknown for his ideas around the ways humans categorize things, and how that power\nmanifests itself in the ways people interact with each other. His work on\ncategorization and power structures is used in many fields including psychology\nand sociology.\n\nOur exploration of gender begins to concern Foucault’s when we begin to question\nthe ways that gender is a categorization of behaviour that influences how we\nexpect people to act and the ways that we act around others.\n\nWithout the concept of categorization, no mechanism of classification or\ndescription would be present.\n\n“…one that does not distribute the multiplicity of existing things into any of\nthe categories that make it possible for us to name, speak, and think.\"[4]\n(Foucault, The order of things: an archaeology of the human sciences, XIX)\n\nGiven the importance of categorization as a method of describing differences and\ncommunicating concepts, what does this mean for gender? Historically, Western\nsociety recognizes two genders, which are rationalized using naturalistic\narguments. We can see in the historical record the factors and power dynamics\nthat lead Western society to settle on two, and the ways naturalistic arguments\nwere constructed to support this idea. Comparatively, modern theorists also have\nrecords of other societies that use more than two categories, providing a\ncounter-example to any naturalistic arguments.\n\nThe way gender categories are formed in different societies is an area of\nparticular interest. Why is it that Western society continues to frame its\npopulations in terms of two genders, despite growing research\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/10930654/Facebooks-71-gender-options-come-to-UK-users.html] \n on and support [http://time.com/4703058/time-cover-story-beyond-he-or-she/] \nfor intersex, trans*, and gender queer people who did not fit into these\ncategories?\n\nThe story of Western gender constructs is largely informed by the power dynamics\nof society. The individuals in power have the power to manipulate the\ncategorizations we use, whether they be church officials like St Thomas Aquinas,\neducators and popular philosophizes like Aristotle, or the people around us who\nmay rely our actions to an authority or someone whom we respect. As we are all\nenforcing, attributing, and assuming each others genders, we are all partially\nresponsible for perpetuating and normalizing the ideas of gender that are often\nperceived to be objective truths.\n\nWhere do we go now?\nWe’ve established that gender is a subjective experience that is constructed as\na sustained performance, but what does this mean for contemporary society?\n\nRevisiting our initial questions going into this exploration:\n\n * What is gender? Where does it come from?\n * How do we understand claims of gender authenticity if there is no biological\n   dichotomy between sexes?\n * Is gender natural or constructed, and what does this mean for contemporary\n   society?\n * Do these questions have a relevant answer in current society?\n\nWe still don’t have a concrete answer to some of these, but perhaps the answers\nare less relevant than we originally believed. How can we move forward where our\nideas of each other are not informed by our stereotypes of a particular role,\nand be more intentional and thoughtful with our interactions?\n\nMoving forward it is important to recognize that popularized ideas surrounding\ngender are a disservice to society. We as a global community can do better, and\nshould work to bring an intersectional and progressive view of gender into more\nmainstream view.\n\nA more important consideration is if we are even capable of fully investigating\nand changing the system. For those of us who live within the systems that we are\naiming to critique, we come to the question how we can have the knowledge to\ncritique it.\n\n“What does it mean when the tools of a racist patriarchy are used to examine the\nfruits of that same patriarchy? It means that only the most narrow perimeters of\nchange are possible and allowable”[5]\n(Lorde, Sister outsider: essays and speeches, pp25)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

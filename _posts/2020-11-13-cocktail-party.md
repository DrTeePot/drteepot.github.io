My friends know that I enjoy a good cocktail, but since most people don't know
how to mix them, hosting cocktail parties is either very expensive (hiring a
bartender), or very time-consuming (being a bartender). 

In an attempt to make a cocktail party work without breaking the bank or
tie-ing up my night, I pre-made ingredients and tried to simplify cocktail
making so everyone could get involved. My friends love a good DIY and hopefully
they learned a bit about mixology in the process![^im-late]

[^im-late]: I wrote the first-draft of this post shortly after hosting, but
    because of procrastinating and a pandemic, I lost steam. So, it's 9
    months late... oops.

## Overview
- I hosted a DIY cocktail party for my 25th birthday.
- People brought their own liquor. I posted good choices and potential
  cocktails before the party.
- Provided pre-mixed syrups, cocktail mixes, juices, and garnishes for a
  variety of cocktails.
- Made cocktail menus that were organized by liquor.

## What went well
- People liked the flexibility, and everyone was involved in an experience.
- I didn't break the bank buying a lot of different liquor.
- Mixing drinks was fun for everyone! Many people began the night with a recipe
  and freestyled more as the night went on. Some people iterated on a single
  recipe.

## The Problems

- **Problem 1:** The ice bucket was small considering the speed it was being
  used (basically all cocktails include a considerable amount of ice). Luckily
  people's desire to add ice went down as the night progressed.

  **Improvement:** Use a cooler in the future to store larger quantities of
  ice. Additionally look into ways to eliminate the ice from the cocktail
  making process (maybe including water in the mix and then keeping the mix
  near freezing?).

- **Problem 2:** People were often waiting behind each other to make drinks,
  use a particular mix, or get ice.

  **Improvement:** Setup mulitple drink stations, maybe one in each room. That
  might half the number of people trying to use any one station.

  Additionally, not everyone cared to make their own cocktails and would do
  something simple. If there was a pitcher option, that would remove some load
  from the cocktail-mixing stations.

- **Problem 3:** The stations and surrounding area got pretty messy (sticky).
  We had plastic down on the tables, but it was still a huge pain to cleanup
  the next day.

  **Improvement:** Not sure! Maybe pre-portioning the mixes would prevent
  errant pouring. Finding a good solution for keeping things cold that doesn't
  involve ice-water would also help.

## Appendix: The cocktails

Many of the recipes were adjusted to make them easier to make. For example, in
drinks that required Campari and vermouth in a configuration other than 1:1, I
still used Campari mix[^campari-syrup] to simplify. This works at a home party
with mostly-undiscerning friends.

Since people brought their own liquor, any adjustments made for the
flavour profile of specific brands would have been pointless. Some people ended
up iterating on a single cocktail recipe, which was a fun experiment!

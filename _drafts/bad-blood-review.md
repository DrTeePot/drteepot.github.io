What happens when unchecked ambition, poorly-regulated capitalism, and a
privatized medical industry intersect?

Theranos.

A company built on a vision of cheap, easy, and non-invasive[^non-invasive]
blood tests. A company that sold faulty tests to consumers while continuously
failing to create the technology that it promised. The fragmented medical and
regulatory systems in the USA, combined with the attitudes of silicon valley
capitalists and the broader American culture around medicine, made a company
like Theranos was inevitable.

[^non-invasive]: Theranos aimed to perform certain blood tests with just a drop
    of blood. << TODO: find a source for how much blood they were aiming for >>

The warning signs were clear, but why didn't anyone take action?
- No evidence that the product worked, after trials with many large
  pharmacuetical companies.
- High executive turnover.
- Multiple employee whistleblowers

The CEO (and company as a whole) is a demonstration of survivorship bias

- Survivorship bias, Sunny (the CEO's partner and later vice president (?fact
  check?) was successful by capitalistic standards, but didn't do anything
  particularly good himself.
- the company existed by unfounded claims and distorted truths. It exists,
  there's all these names attached, it must be real?
- what happens when your investment people aren't educated in the field they
  are investing in?
- Why does the USA view medicine as such a black box, they are so trusting of
  literally everything. And so untrusting / uncaring about their regulatory
  authorities.
- Is there a solution in the US for this kind of thing? 
- Why didn't the board do something about this earlier? Why did nobody verify
  anything? Even after whistleblowers and shady deals, high turnover.
- it's unsurprising the employees went along with it, but it does show the 
  need for more transparent processes for companies. Why also did employees 
  not report this to the relevant authority? Likely too complicated, unknown
  authority.



## Highlights:

"evangelizing was what successful startup founders did in Silicon Valley. You
didn’t change the world by being cynical." (Page: 6)
                
"So they’d recorded a result from one of the times it worked. It was that
recorded result that was displayed at the end of each demo." (Page: 6)
                
"“Henry, you’re not a team player,” she said in an icy tone. “I think you
should leave right now.”" (Page: 8)
                
"people deciding not to spend their lives on something purposeful, and what
happens to them when they make that choice—the impact on character and quality
of life.”" (Page: 10)
                
"The chemistry work was handled by a separate group made up of biochemists. The
collaboration between that group and Ed’s group was far from optimal. Both
reported up to Elizabeth but weren’t encouraged to communicate with each other.
Elizabeth liked to keep information compartmentalized so that only she had the
full picture of the system’s development." (Page: 20)
                
"so laser focused on achieving her goals that she seemed oblivious to the
practical implications of her decisions." (Page: 21)
                
"Ellison might be one of the richest people in the world, with a net worth of
some $25 billion, but he wasn’t necessarily the ideal role model. In Oracle’s
early years, he had famously exaggerated his database software’s capabilities
and shipped versions of it crawling with bugs. That’s not something you could
do with a medical device." (Page: 22)
                
"In case they hadn’t noticed yet, people were constantly getting fired at
Theranos, Aaron told them. Ana and Justin had definitely noticed." (Page: 33)
                
"“When you strike at the king, you must kill him.” Todd Surdey and Michael
Esquivel had struck at the king, or rather the queen. But she’d survived."
(Page: 51)
                
"Chelsea even learned a new expression: to disappear someone." (Page: 77)
                
"The scientists, especially, were afraid of Sunny." (Page: 77)
                
"The company was lurching from one ill-conceived initiative to another like a
child with attention deficit disorder." (Page: 78)
                
"They’d wanted to control the narrative of her departure." (Page: 80)
                
"Ian nodded. “It’s a folie à deux,” he said. Tony didn’t know any French, so he
left to go look up the expression in the dictionary. The definition he found
struck him as apt: “The presence of the same or similar delusional ideas in two
persons closely associated with one another.”" (Page: 144)
                
"Most were on H-1B visas and dependent on their continued employment at the
company to remain in the country." (Page: 164)
                
"she emitted a reality distortion field that forced people to momentarily
suspend disbelief." (Page: 291)
                
"Hyping your product to get funding while concealing your true progress and
hoping that reality will eventually catch up to the hype continues to be
tolerated in the tech industry." (Page: 297)
